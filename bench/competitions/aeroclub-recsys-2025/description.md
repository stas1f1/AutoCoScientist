# FlightRank 2025: Aeroclub RecSys Cup

Personalized Flight Recommendations for Business Travelers

## Overview

Welcome aboard! ✈️

Imagine you're a business traveler searching for flights. You see dozens or even thousands of options with different prices, airlines, departure times, and durations. What makes you click "Book Now" on one specific flight? This competition challenges you to decode those preferences and build a recommendation system that can predict business traveler choices.

### Competition Goal

Build an intelligent flights ranking model that predicts which flight option a business traveler will choose from search results.

## Description

Business travel presents unique challenges for recommendation systems. Unlike leisure travelers who prioritize cost or vacation preferences, business travelers must balance multiple competing factors: corporate travel policies, meeting schedules, expense compliance, and personal convenience. This creates complex decision patterns that are difficult to predict.

This competition challenges participants to solve a group-wise ranking problem where your models must rank flight options within each user search session. Each search session (ranker_id) represents a real user query with multiple flight alternatives, but only one chosen option. Your task is to build a model that can rank these options and identify the most likely selection.

### The Challenge

The dataset contains real flight search sessions with various attributes including pricing, timing, route information, user features and booking policies. The key technical challenge lies in ranking flight options to identify the most suitable choices for each business traveler on their specific route and circumstances. This becomes particularly complex as the number of available options can vary dramatically - from a handful of alternatives on smaller routes to thousands of possibilities on major trunk routes. Your model must effectively rank this entire spectrum of options to enhance the user experience by accurately identifying which flights best match traveler preferences.

### Why This Matters

Flight recommendation systems power major travel platforms serving millions of business travelers. Accurate ranking models can significantly improve user experience by surfacing relevant options faster, ultimately leading to higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

Your model will be evaluated based on ranking quality - how well it places the actually selected flight at the top of each search session's ranked list.

## Evaluation

### HitRate@3

Competition metric HitRate@3 measures the fraction of search sessions where the correct flight appears in your top-3 predictions.

$HitRate@3 = \frac{1}{|Q|} \sum_{i=1}^{|Q|} \mathbf{1}(rank_i \leq 3)$

Where:

- `|Q|` is the number of search queries (unique `ranker_id` values)
- `rank_i` is the rank position you assigned to the correct flight in query `i`
- `𝟙(rank_i ≤ 3)` is 1 if the correct flight is in top-3, 0 otherwise

**Example:** If the correct flight is ranked 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, you get 1.0 points. Otherwise, you get 0 points.

**Score range:** 0 to 1, where 1 means the correct flight is always in top-3

### Important Note on Group Size Filtering

The metric evaluation will only consider groups (`ranker_id`) with **more than 10 flight options**. Groups with 10 or fewer options are excluded from the final score calculation to focus on more challenging ranking scenarios where distinguishing between options is meaningful.

However, we have intentionally kept these smaller groups in both the training and test datasets because:

- They represent real-world search scenarios
- They provide additional training signal for your models
- They help capture the full diversity of user behavior patterns

## Submission Format

### Training Data Target

In the training data, the `selected` column is binary:

- `1` = This flight was chosen by the traveler
- `0` = This flight was not chosen

**Important:** There is exactly one row with `selected=1` per user search request (`ranker_id`). Each row within a `ranker_id` group represents a different flight option returned by the search system for that specific route and date.

Training data example:

```csv
Id,ranker_id,selected
100,abc123,0     # Flight option 1 - not chosen
101,abc123,0     # Flight option 2 - not chosen
102,abc123,1,    # Flight option 3 - SELECTED by user
103,abc123,0     # Flight option 4 - not chosen
```

### Submission Format

Your submission must contain `ranks` (not probabilities) for each flight option:

```csv
Id,ranker_id,selected
100,abc123,4
101,abc123,2
102,abc123,1
103,abc123,3
```

Where:

- `Id` matches the row identifier from the test set
- `ranker_id` is the search session identifier (same as in test.csv)
- `selected` is the `rank` you assign (1 = best option, 2 = second best, etc.)

**Important:** Maintain the exact same row order as in `test.csv`

In this example, your model predicts that:

- Row 102 (Id=102) is the best option → Rank 1
- Row 101 (Id=101) is second best → Rank 2
- Row 103 (Id=103) is third best → Rank 3
- Row 100 (Id=100) is the worst option → Rank 4

### Submission Requirements

- **Preserve row order:** Maintain the exact same row order as in `test.csv`
- **Complete rankings:** For each user search request, you must rank ALL flight options returned by the search system
- **Valid permutation:** Ranks within each `ranker_id` must be a valid permutation (1, 2, 3, …, N) where N is the number of rows in that group
- **No duplicate ranks:** Each row within a `ranker_id` group must have a unique rank
- **Integer values:** All ranks must be integers ≥ 1

### Example for one user search request:

```
Training data shows:
ranker_id: abc123 → Row 102 was chosen (selected=1)

Your submission:
ranker_id: abc123
├── Row 100 → Rank 4 (worst option)
├── Row 101 → Rank 2 (second best)
├── Row 102 → Rank 1 (best - correctly predicted!)
└── Row 103 → Rank 3 (third best)
```

### Validation

Your submission will be validated for:

- Correct number of rows
- Integer rank values
- Valid rank permutations within each group
- No duplicate ranks per search session
- Basic anti-cheating measures

**Note:** The evaluation system expects you to transform your model's output (scores/probabilities) into ranks before submission. Higher model scores should correspond to lower rank numbers (1 = best).

## Submission Format

### Training Data Target

In the training data, the selected column is **binary**:

- 1 = This flight was chosen by the traveler
- 0 = This flight was not chosen

**Important:** There is exactly one row with `selected=1` per user search request (`ranker_id`). Each row within a `ranker_id` group represents a different flight option returned by the search system for that specific route and date.

**Training data example:**

```
Id,ranker_id,selected
100,abc123,0     # Flight option 1 - not chosen
101,abc123,0     # Flight option 2 - not chosen
102,abc123,1,    # Flight option 3 - SELECTED by user
103,abc123,0     # Flight option 4 - not chosen
```

### Submission Format

Your submission must contain ranks (not probabilities) for each flight option:

```
Id,ranker_id,selected
100,abc123,4
101,abc123,2
102,abc123,1
103,abc123,3
```

Where:

- `Id` matches the row identifier from the test set
- `ranker_id` is the search session identifier (same as in test.csv)
- `selected` is the **rank** you assign (1 = best option, 2 = second best, etc.)

**Important:** Maintain the exact same row order as in test.csv

In this example, your model predicts that:

- Row 102 (Id=102) is the best option → Rank 1
- Row 101 (Id=101) is second best → Rank 2
- Row 103 (Id=103) is third best → Rank 3
- Row 100 (Id=100) is the worst option → Rank 4

### Submission Requirements

- **Preserve row order:** Maintain the exact same row order as in test.csv
- **Complete rankings:** For each user search request, you must rank ALL flight options returned by the search system
- **Valid permutation:** Ranks within each ranker_id must be a valid permutation (1, 2, 3, …, N) where N is the number of rows in that group
- **No duplicate ranks:** Each row within a ranker_id group must have a unique rank
- **Integer values:** All ranks must be integers ≥ 1

**Example for one user search request:**

```
Training data shows:
ranker_id: abc123 → Row 102 was chosen (selected=1)

Your submission:
ranker_id: abc123
├── Row 100 → Rank 4 (worst option)
├── Row 101 → Rank 2 (second best)
├── Row 102 → Rank 1 (best - correctly predicted!)
└── Row 103 → Rank 3 (third best)
```

### Validation

Your submission will be validated for:

- Correct number of rows
- Integer rank values
- Valid rank permutations within each group
- No duplicate ranks per search session
- Basic anti-cheating measures

**Note:** The evaluation system expects you to transform your model's output (scores/probabilities) into ranks before submission. Higher model scores should correspond to lower rank numbers (1 = best).
